Building the maze was straight forward using the assets from the tutorial only. Newer Unity Editor versions however do support other XR integration manager, here minor tweaks were necessary. Most challenging was the integration of a button logic to open the bookshelf. After some invested time and video tutorials on youtube I needed to let this go and reiterate the key logic for the bookshelf to deactive upon object mechanism - however I could reuse the hands for my scene, which is already some progression :). One other challenge is surely the interaction layer mapping, since I was not able to access the interaction log script, here I needed to skip some logic points, which led ulitmately to a reduced teleportation experience. This might be readjusted at a later stage in time. Best, Benjamin
